                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>Crocs was founded by Scott Seamans, Lyndon "Duke" Hanson, and George Boedecker, Jr. to produce and distribute a foam clog[4] design acquired from a company called Foam Creations. The shoe was originally developed as a boating shoe. The first model produced by Crocs, the Beach, was unveiled in 2002 at the Fort Lauderdale Boat Show in Florida, and sold out the 200 pairs produced at that time.[5] It has since sold 300 million pairs of shoes.</p>

                        Crocs are made in a variety of colors.
                        Crocs are made in a variety of styles. They are manufactured in Crocs plants in Italy and Mexico, both of which are slated to close by the end of 2018, whereupon Crocs manufacturing will be entirely outsourced.[13]
                        
                        The shoes are produced in an array of colors, depending on the model. The Classic styles are available in more than 20 colors; most other styles are produced in a palette of four to six colors or two-color combinations. There are different styles of Crocs that are made so they can be worn in any season.
                        
                        Crocs also sells other fashion accessories. Jibbitz are decorations that can be clipped to the ventilation holes in the shoes. These include designs, mainly aimed at children, which feature Disney characters. The company has also released a line of purses in a variety of colors.
                        
                        A "Fuzz Collection" with removable woolly liners extend the range into winter wear.
                        
                        In 2008, the company entered the golf shoe marketplace, acquiring golf shoe manufacturer Bite Footwear. A Croc-styled pair of golf shoes, the Ace, was introduced.</p>
